of Autopilot Systems</h3>\n<p>Autopilot systems control aircraft stability across three axes: roll, pitch, and yaw. They can be classified based on the number of control axes they manage.</p>\n<h4>1.&nbsp;<strong>Single Axis System</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control Axis</strong>: Roll (Ailerons)</li>\n<li><strong>Function</strong>: Controls lateral stability, typically used to level the wings.</li>\n<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Basic autopilot system, also known as a&nbsp;<strong>Wing Leveller</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Control Loop</strong>: One inner loop for roll control.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.&nbsp;<strong>Two Axis System</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control Axes</strong>: Roll (Ailerons) and Pitch (Elevators)</li>\n<li><strong>Function</strong>: Controls both lateral and longitudinal stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Provides basic attitude control, but does not manage yaw.</li>\n<li><strong>Control Loops</strong>: Two inner loops, one for roll and one for pitch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.&nbsp;<strong>Three Axis System</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control Axes</strong>: Roll (Ailerons), Pitch (Elevators), and Yaw (Rudder)</li>\n<li><strong>Function</strong>: Controls stability across all three axes.</li>\n<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Provides full attitude control, including coordinated turns and autoland capability.</li>\n<li><strong>Control Loops</strong>: Three inner loops, one for each axis of control (roll, pitch, and yaw).</li>\n<li><strong>Yaw Control</strong>: Often interacts with the roll channel to maintain coordinated flight and faster stability response.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A&nbsp;<strong>three-axis autopilot</strong>&nbsp;is required for autoland functionality, providing complete control over the aircraft’s attitude in all axes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","subject":"Instruments","book":"Pilot Shala Practice

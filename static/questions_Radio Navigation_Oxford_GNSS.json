Propagation errors primarily occur in the <strong>ionosphere</strong> and <strong>troposphere</strong>, which can cause the signal to slow down and lead to inaccuracies in position calculations.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ionospheric Delay</strong>: The ionosphere can cause delays as it is a charged layer of particles that affects the speed of the GPS signal. The effect can vary depending on solar activity and the time of day.</li>\n<li><strong>Tropospheric Delay</strong>: The troposphere, the lower layer of the atmosphere, can also cause delays, particularly due to the presence of moisture. While the tropospheric effect is less significant than ionospheric errors, it can still cause small inaccuracies in positioning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. <strong>Selective Availability (SA)</strong>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Selective Availability</strong> was a deliberate degradation of the GPS signal by the U.S. government to reduce the accuracy of civilian GPS receivers for security reasons. This degradation limited the accuracy of civilian GPS to around 100 meters. However, <strong>Selective Availability</strong> was discontinued in May 2000, and since then, civilian GPS receivers have access to more accurate signals. If SA were reactivated in the future, it would again introduce errors in the position calculation for civilian users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. <strong>Ephemeris Errors</strong>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ephemeris</strong> data refers to the precise orbital information of the GPS satellites. If the ephemeris data is inaccurate or outdated, the GPS receiver may incorrectly compute the satellite’s position, leading to errors in the derived position. Ephemeris data is regularly updated, but errors can still occur if the data isn’t refreshed in time or if there is a significant issue with satellite health or tracking.</li>\n</ul>\n","subject":"Radio Navigation","book":"Pilot Shala Practice Set","topic":"GNSS"},{"image":"","difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d5ed715cc08c3f01239","question":"The NAVSTAR/ GPS control segment comprises:","choices":[{"_id":"68bfe3657e53995f42887090","isCorrect":false,"choice":"the space segment, the user segment and the ground segment"},{"_id":"68bfe3657e53995f42887091","isCorrect":false,"choice":"a ground segment and the INMARSAT geostationary satellites"},{"_id":"68bfe3657e53995f42887092","isCorrect":true,"choice":"a master control station, a back-up control station and five monitoring stations"},{"_id":"68bfe3657e53995f42887093","isCorrect":false,"choice":"a master control station, a back-up control station, five monitoring stations and the INMARSAT geostationary satellites"}],"explanation":"<p>The <strong>NAVSTAR GPS Control Segment</strong> consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>Master Control Station (MCS)</strong> located at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado, responsible for overall satellite management and control.</li>\n<li>A <strong>Back-up Control Station</strong> to ensure operational continuity in case the Master Control Station is unavailable.</li>\n<li><strong>Five Monitoring Stations</strong> that track the position and health of GPS satellites, providing real-time data to support satellite operations.</li>\n</ul>\n","subject":"Radio Navigation","book":"Pilot Shala Practice Set","topic":"GNSS"},{"difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d5ed715cc08c3f0123a","question":"The orbital height and inclination of the NAVSTAR/GPS constellation are:","choices":[{"isCorrect":false,"choice":"20180 km, 65°","_id":"68403855ad3e707c20cf81c3"},{"isCorrect":true,"choice":"20180 km, 55°","_id":"68403855ad3e707c20cf81c4"},{"isCorrect":false,"choice":"19099 km, 65°","_id":"68403855ad3e707c20cf81c5"},{"isCorrect":false,"choice":"19099 km, 55°","_id":"68403855ad3e707c20cf81c6"}],"image":"https://i0.wp.com/eatpl.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1587893833094.png?resize=780%2C632&ssl=1","explanation":"<p>The NAVSTAR/GPS satellites orbit the Earth at an <strong>altitude of approximately 20,200 kilometers (12,550 miles) and are inclined 55 degrees from the equator</strong>.

This time is correlated with <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>, ensuring synchronization with global time standards. Here’s a breakdown of how this works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Satellite Time (Onboard Atomic Clock)</strong>: Each GNSS satellite is equipped with a highly accurate atomic clock, which measures time in <strong>seconds</strong>.

The week number is transmitted in the <strong>navigation message</strong> of the GPS signal, allowing the receiver to know the current week.</li>\n<li><strong>Seconds of Week (SOW)</strong>: The <strong>seconds of the week</strong> count is transmitted by each satellite, and it is used to determine the exact time when the signal was sent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation with UTC</strong>: Although the satellites run their own atomic clocks, these clocks are synchronized with <strong>UTC</strong>.

The motor is mounted in such a way that it vibrates the laser ring about its input axis<br>\nthrough the lock in region, thereby unlocking the beams and enabling the optical sensor to<br>\ndetect the smaller movement of the fringe pattern. The motions caused by the dither motor<br>\nare decoupled from the output of the ring laser gyro / rate sensor.</p>\n","subject":"Instruments","book":"Pilotshala Practice Set","topic":"Inertial Reference System"}]

may be subject to the following errors:</p>\n<h3>1. <strong>Propagation Errors</strong>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>These errors are caused by the delays in the GPS signal as it travels through different layers of the Earth’s atmosphere. Propagation errors primarily occur in the <strong>ionosphere</strong> and <strong>troposphere</strong>, which can cause the signal to slow down and lead to inaccuracies in position calculations.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ionospheric Delay</strong>: The ionosphere can cause delays as it is a charged layer of particles that affects the speed of the GPS signal. The effect can vary depending on solar activity and the time of day.</li>\n<li><strong>Tropospheric Delay</strong>: The troposphere, the lower layer of the atmosphere, can also cause delays, particularly due to the presence of moisture. While the tropospheric effect is less significant than ionospheric errors, it can still cause small inaccuracies in positioning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. <strong>Selective Availability (SA)</strong>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Selective Availability</strong> was a deliberate degradation of the GPS signal by the U.S. government to reduce the accuracy of civilian GPS receivers for security reasons. This degradation limited the accuracy of civilian GPS to around 100 meters. However, <strong>Selective Availability</strong> was discontinued in May 2000, and since then, civilian GPS receivers have access to more accurate signals. If SA were reactivated in the future, it would again introduce errors in the position calculation for civilian users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. <strong>Ephemeris Errors</strong>:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ephemeris</strong> data refers to the precise orbital information of the GPS satellites. If the ephemeris data is inaccurate or outdated, the GPS receiver may incorrectly compute the satellite’s position, leading to errors in the derived position. Ephemeris data is regularly updated, but errors can still occur if the data isn’t refreshed in time or if there is a significant issue with satellite health or tracking.</li>\n</ul>\n","subject":"Radio Navigation","book":"Pilotshala Practice Set","topic":"GNSS"},{"image":"","difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d5ed715cc08c3f011d1","question":"Signal reception is required from a minimum number of satellites that have adequate elevation and suitable geometry in order for a Satellite-Assisted Navigation System (GPS) to carry out independent three-dimensional operation without the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) function.

This system of corrections allows users to obtain more precise and reliable positioning.</p>\n<h3>Summary:</h3>\n<p>EGNOS is a vital component of the European GNSS infrastructure, significantly improving the performance of GPS by providing accurate corrections and integrity monitoring.

This time is correlated with <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>, ensuring synchronization with global time standards. Here’s a breakdown of how this works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Satellite Time (Onboard Atomic Clock)</strong>: Each GNSS satellite is equipped with a highly accurate atomic clock, which measures time in <strong>seconds</strong>. The satellite’s clock is essential for the accurate calculation of the distance between the satellite and the receiver, which is based on the time it takes for the signal to travel.</li>\n<li><strong>Week and Second Count</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GPS Week Number</strong>: The GPS system uses a <strong>week number</strong> to keep track of time. The GPS week count started from <strong>January 6, 1980</strong> and is incremented every week. The week number is transmitted in the <strong>navigation message</strong> of the GPS signal, allowing the receiver to know the current week.</li>\n<li><strong>Seconds of Week (SOW)</strong>: The <strong>seconds of the week</strong> count is transmitted by each satellite, and it is used to determine the exact time when the signal was sent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation with UTC</strong>: Although the satellites run their own atomic clocks, these clocks are synchronized with <strong>UTC</strong>. However, due to slight inaccuracies in the satellite clocks compared to UTC, the GPS system introduces a small <strong>correction</strong> factor, called <strong>UTC offset</strong>. This offset ensures that the time derived from GPS is in sync with UTC.</li>\n<li><strong>Why It’s Important</strong>: The precise time measurements from satellites are critical for the GNSS system’s functioning:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Position Calculation</strong>: The receiver calculates its position by determining the time it takes for signals from multiple satellites to reach it. The time is measured based on the onboard satellite clocks.</li>\n<li><strong>Time Accuracy</strong>: The precise time correlation between satellites’ clocks and UTC allows for high-precision positioning, with accuracy in the range of meters, depending on the number of satellites and other factors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the GNSS satellite clocks operate on <strong>atomic time</strong>, are counted in <strong>weeks and seconds</strong>, and are synchronized with <strong>UTC</strong> to maintain accurate time for positioning.</p>\n","subject":"Radio Navigation","book":"Pilotshala Practice Set","topic":"GNSS"},{"image":"","difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d5ed715cc08c3f011db","question":"GPS systems transmit their signals on two carrier waves 1575 MHz and 1227 MHz and supply two possible codes accessible according to user (civil or military).

(Pseudo-Random Noise) codes</strong> are indeed used to <strong>determine the time interval between the satellite transmission and receipt of the signal at the receiver</strong>. Here’s a more detailed explanation:</p>\n<h3>Role of PRN Codes in GPS:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Time Synchronization</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>PRN codes are unique sequences of bits transmitted by each satellite. When a GPS receiver receives a signal from a satellite, it needs to determine the time at which the signal was transmitted.</li>\n<li>Since the receiver doesn’t know exactly when the satellite transmitted the signal, it uses the PRN code, which is a known sequence, to calculate the <strong>time offset</strong>.</li>\n<li>The receiver <strong>cross-correlates</strong> the PRN code it has stored with the signal it receives. By determining the point where the received code matches the known code, the receiver calculates the <strong>time delay</strong> between the transmission and receipt of the signal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Positioning</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Once the receiver has the time interval (or delay) from at least four satellites, it can use <strong>trilateration</strong> to calculate its <strong>position</strong>. The time delay is converted into a distance because the signal from the satellite travels at the speed of light.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Accurate Time Measurement</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>The PRN codes also help in determining <strong>precise timing</strong>, which is crucial for accurate positioning. GPS satellites have atomic clocks, and the timing accuracy is transferred to the receiver via the PRN codes, allowing the receiver to calculate its position with high accuracy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Identification of Satellites</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Each satellite transmits a unique PRN code that identifies it, allowing the receiver to differentiate between signals from different satellites.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the <strong>PRN codes</strong> are critical for <strong>measuring the time of flight</strong> (the time it takes for the signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver), enabling <strong>time synchronization</strong>, and ultimately allowing the GPS receiver to accurately calculate its position.</p>\n","subject":"Radio Navigation","book":"Pilotshala Practice Set","topic":"GNSS"}]

Rules) to VFR (Visual Flight Rules), the following procedure should be followed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The pilot should notify the ATS</strong> (Air Traffic Services) authority of the cancellation of the IFR flight using the specific phrase: <strong>“cancelling my IFR flight.”</strong> This is crucial for ensuring that the ATS is aware of the pilot’s intention to switch flight rules.</li>\n<li><strong>Updating Flight Plan</strong>: After notifying the ATS, the pilot should communicate the necessary changes to the current flight plan to reflect the change to VFR conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>ATC Acknowledgment</strong>: Upon receiving the cancellation notification, ATC will respond by confirming the cancellation with a message that includes the time, such as <strong>“IFR cancelled at … (time).”</strong> This confirmation is important for maintaining clear communication between the pilot and air traffic control.</li>\n</ol>\n","subject":"Regulations","book":"Pilot Shala Practice Set","topic":"Rules of Air"},{"image":"","difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d59d715cc08c3f00554","question":"In the event of

class=\"text-italics\">The aircraft transmits a stream of pairs of pulses to the ground station. The two pulses in each pair are separated by 12 micro seconds. After a short delay of 50 microseconds the ground station then retransmits them. The time delay between sending and receiving the pulses is converted to a range readout. The aircraft equipment is known as the interrogator, as it initiates the exchange. The ground equipment is called a transponder as it replies. The aeroplane must distinguish between its own pulses returning and those of other aircraft. So the pulse trains are made unique to each aeroplane by using a random or “jittered” PRF. Therefore the time interval between the paired pulses is random and the chance of two pulse trains being identical is effectively nil. The aeroplane must distinguish between retransmitted pulses from the transponder and reflected pulses from the ground. To overcome this the transponder on the ground retransmits at a different frequency, 63 MHz apart from the interrogator. To make sure that the ground equipment is not triggered by other UHF transmissions it will only reply to pairs of pulses separated by 12 micro seconds.</em></p>\n","subject":"Radio Navigation","book":"Pilot Shala Practice Set","topic":"DME"},{"image":"","difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d5ed715cc08c3f0117b","question":"The accuracy associated with DME is:","choices":[{"_id":"68bfe3647e53995f42887015","isCorrect":false,"choice":"+ or - 3% of range, or 0.5nm, whichever is greater"},{"_id":"68bfe3647e53995f42887016","isCorrect":false,"choice":"+ or - 1.25% of range"},{"_id":"68bfe3647e53995f42887017","isCorrect":false,"choice":"+ or - 3% of range"},{"_id":"68bfe3647e53995f42887018","isCorrect":true,"choice":"+/-0.25 nm +/-1.25% of range"}],"explanation":"<p>ICAO require accuracy of 0.25 nm plus 1.25% in slant range measurement for systems installed before 01 January 1989.

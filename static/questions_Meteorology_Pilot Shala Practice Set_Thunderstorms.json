It grows progressively by collision with supercooled water drops while being tossed up and down in the cloud. Hailstone has onion like structure of alternate layers of rime and clear ice. Clear ice forms nearer the freezing level and rime ice above. When updraughts are unable to hold it, hail falls out of the cloud. Worst hail occurs from freezing level to about 25,000 ft height. Hail encounters by aircraft are rare, but even if encountered it is only in a small region of the cloud. Aircraft encountering small hail may cause superficial damage, but large hail cause serious damage. With large hails the airframes get badly dented, windscreens holed, astrodomes shattered, deicer boots ripped off and fins badly bent. Damaging hail may occur up to 45,000 ft in CB and under the Anvil. (Size of hail – max Dia 5.5in).

It is a nearly circular cluster of many interacting TS over a very large area. This area may be thousand times the area of an Air mass TS. New TS develop continually within an MCC. This increases the life of TS from 6 to 24 hr. These produce severe weather and even Tornadoes and Flash Floods (a sudden rise in the level of rivers or streams causing floods). These are synoptic scale systems, They form near fronts and in tropics in ITCZ.</p>\\n","subject":"Meteorology","book":"Pilot Shala Practice

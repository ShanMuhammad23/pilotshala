Over a short period of time each FMC will change the FMC position to the appropriate IRS position. The reason for the de-coupling is that the calculation of change of longitude from departure is a function of the secant of latitude, which, at values approaching 90°, is increasing rapidly (e.g. sec 86°00 = 14.3356, sec 86°01′ = 14.3955).

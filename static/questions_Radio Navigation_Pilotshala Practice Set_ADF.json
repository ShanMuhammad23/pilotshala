errors."},{"_id":"692fba96bff3ef35cc6af97f","isCorrect":false,"choice":"Night effect is a result if interference of the surface wave and the space wave causing a reduction is range."},{"_id":"692fba96bff3ef35cc6af980","isCorrect":true,"choice":"The mountain effect is caused by reflection onto steep slopes of mountainous terrain which may cause big errors in the bearing."}],"explanation":null,"subject":"Radio Navigation","book":"Pilotshala Practice Set","topic":"ADF"}]

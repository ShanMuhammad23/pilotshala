This occurs because the visual cues from the runway’s width are misleading. To compensate for this illusion, pilots might fly a <strong>flatter than normal approach</strong>, potentially leading to an undershoot of the runway. This is due to the mistaken belief that they are higher than they are, causing them to adjust their descent rate too steeply.</p>\n","subject":"Regulations","book":"Pilot Shala Practice Set","topic":"Sample Paper 14"},{"image":"","difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d59d715cc08c3f0063b","question":"Motor programs are:","choices":[{"_id":"6863fd03be49abd56cf14b5d","isCorrect":true,"choice":"Stored routines that enable patterns of behavior to be executed without continuous conscious control."},{"_id":"6863fd03be49abd56cf14b5e","isCorrect":false,"choice":"Rules that enable us to deal with preconceived situations."},{"_id":"6863fd03be49abd56cf14b5f","isCorrect":false,"choice":"Stored routines that enable patterns of behavior to be executed only under continuous conscious control."}],"explanation":"<p>Motor programs are <strong>stored routines</strong> that allow patterns of behavior to be executed <strong>without continuous conscious control</strong>. They are typically learned behaviors or actions that become automatic with practice, such as walking, driving, or playing an instrument. These routines are stored in memory and can be triggered without requiring active, ongoing conscious effort. This enables individuals to perform complex tasks smoothly and efficiently without having to think about every detail of the movement.</p>\n","subject":"Regulations","book":"Pilot Shala Practice Set","topic":"Sample Paper 14"},{"image":"","difficulty":"medium","_id":"682e9d59d715cc08c3f0063c","question":"If during flight a pilot is in a mental condition of “optimum arousal” he/she will be:","choices":[{"_id":"6863fd03be49abd56cf14b60","isCorrect":false,"choice":"Unprepared to handle a difficult situation."},{"_id":"6863fd03be49abd56cf14b61","isCorrect":true,"choice":"Prepared best to cope with a difficult task."},{"_id":"6863fd03be49abd56cf14b62","isCorrect":false,"choice":"In a confused mental state."}],"explanation":"<p>If a pilot is in a mental state of <strong>“optimum arousal,”</strong> they will be <strong>best prepared to cope with a difficult task.</strong> This state refers to a balanced mental condition where the pilot is neither overly stressed nor under-stimulated.
